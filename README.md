# Safety planning Android app

Along with working with the [National Domestic Violence Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/) organization, we developed a mobile app to help individuals navigate abusive relationships by 
providing personalized guidance, secure information storage, and access to local support resources. 
The app is expected to offer flexible planning, privacy features, 
and regular reminders to ensure users can manage and update their safety plans as their situations change.

We implemented the following features:
- Login and Signup page using Firebase
- Tailored questionnaire...
- A list of tips based on questionnaire given
- Storage of Emergency Info
  - Upload important documents or photos
  - Create a list of emergency contacts, medications, and any safe locations
- Direct Links to local support services
- Reminders & Plan Review Notifications
- Emergency Exit Button
